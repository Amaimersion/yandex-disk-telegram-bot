    such values.
    - keep in mind that Telegram, Heroku, etc. have request timeout.
    It is about 30 seconds, but actual value can be different.
    If you don't end current request in a long time, then it will

    Try to always use background task queue, not block current thread.
    If you have no opportunity to use background task queue, then
