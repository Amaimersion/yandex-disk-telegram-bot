    Notes:
    - don't remove any keys from configuration, because code logic
    can depend on this. Instead set disable value (if code logic
    supports it); or set empty value and edit code logic to handle
    such values.
    - keep in mind that Telegram, Heroku, etc. have request timeout.
    It is about 30 seconds, but actual value can be different.
    If you don't end current request in a long time, then it will
    be force closed. Telegram will send new request in that case.
    Try to always use background task queue, not block current thread.
    If you have no opportunity to use background task queue, then
    change current configuration in order request with blocked thread
    cannot take long time to complete.
